2. Definitions of some terms:
   - Amicable numbers : A pair of numbers, each of which is the sum of the factors of the other.
   - Armstrong numbers : It is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.

2. Definitions of some terms:
   - Abstraction : It is about hiding unwanted details while giving out most essential details. For eg. while making a game, we have a Player class which has different methods. Theperson executing the code will only know the names of the methods but not how they are implemented.
   - Encapsulation : It means hiding the code and data into a single unit. For eg. in the same Player class, there are different methods which are encapsulated inside that class.
